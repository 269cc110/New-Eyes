# New-Eyes
A code compendium comparing different programming paradigms.

Everyone is encouraged to submit a ton of small (1-100 lines) programs. There are a lot of beginners to coding, so the purpose of this repo is:

 * to showcase different programming styles
 * to teach people how to translate code into different paradigms if they're learning a new one
 * to help new learners see a lot of code written in different ways
 * to have a single source of truth for all the most common programs we admins see around many programming-related Facebook groups. 
 
 No longer will you have to ask "How do I write this?"

Programs should have these criteria:
 * between 1 and 100 significant lines of code
 * need explanatory comments (this is intended for beginners)
 * do not need to have any specific purpose (the point is to see the same code in different ways)
 * identifiers should be descriptively named, if not commented
 * comments should not take the form 
 ```
 /*
  * @param ...
  * ...
 */
 ```
 * for a small function because come on, that takes up too much space and it's not like I'm gonna be using doxygen or anything. They're small code snippets, let's be real here.
